    <h1>Galactaburger</h1>
    <p>
        Galactaburger was a project I worked on last semester with a group. I did all of the 3d parts of the game. I wanted to challenge myself by making all of the 3d stuff myself.
        This was a first person controller, a monster that could pathfind around with different states.

    <p>There are so many things I worked on that I think the best thing to start off with is showing a gameplay video of my section of the game.</p>
