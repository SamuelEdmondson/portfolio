        Galactaburger was a project I worked on last semester with a group. I did all of the 3d parts of the game. I wanted to challenge myself by making all of the 3d stuff myself.
    </p>

    <p>I am planning on writing up more about the game but for now I decided to just show the 3d parts of the game that were made.</p>
    <p>The plan is to write up more about how the monster's AI works as well as how I did the interaction system, and programming the music sound effects to fade in and out.</p>
    <p>Here is a <a href="https://turtlespitz.itch.io/galactaburger" target="_blank">link</a> to the download.</p>
    <p>Below is footage of the gameplay.</p>
